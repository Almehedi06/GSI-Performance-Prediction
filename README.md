# GSI-Performance-Prediction  

Welcome to my repository on **AI-based modeling for Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) performance prediction**. This project explores the integration of **machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and physics-informed AI** to enhance the prediction of **stormwater management systems** in urban environments.  

## Why This Matters?  
Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) is crucial for **mitigating urban flooding, improving water quality, and providing ecosystem benefits**. However, traditional physics-based models are computationally expensive and require extensive calibration, while purely data-driven ML models may struggle with generalizability and physical consistency. This research investigates **hybrid approaches** to overcome these challenges.  

## Project Scope  
This repository presents a comparative study of various **ML/DL models** for predicting GSI performance, including:  
âœ… **Linear Regression (LR)** â€“ A simple statistical benchmark.  
âœ… **Random Forest (RF)** â€“ A non-parametric ensemble learning model.  
âœ… **Data-Driven LSTM (DDLSTM)** â€“ A deep learning approach for time-series analysis.  
âœ… **Physics-Informed LSTM (PILSTM)** â€“ A hybrid model embedding physical constraints into ML predictions.  

The study evaluates these models on their ability to predict **stormwater ponding depth (dPD)** across diverse multi-season storm events, ensuring a balance between **accuracy, efficiency, and generalization** for real-world urban hydrology applications.
